RPItems
==========

A Bukkit plugin that aims to enhance the items of Minecraft, adding traditional Role Playing Game elements.

We use a Jenkins server for building the final plugin. The server can be found <a href="http://jenkins.scott-woodward.com">here</a>

Any suggestions can be made via tickets on github, or via pull request.
